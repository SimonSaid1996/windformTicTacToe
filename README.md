# windformTicTacToe
a C# program i created using windform. 5 connected pieces to win the game in a 15*15 size game board
despite the fact that the game has minor problems of game window not openining correctly in the beginning(need manual adjust to see all the buttons) and the existing game events doesn't get cleared once restart, the rest of the game is working properly.

feel free to do some adjustment on the program if anyone'd like, since my original program is also inspired by several websites. as long as it is not for commercial uses, i will not mind
